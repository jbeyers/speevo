Speevo
======

A Persistence Of Vision Speedometer
===================================

What is it?
-----------

Speevo is an Arduino-based visual speedometer. Attach it to anything that moves, look at a stationary point while it goes past, and you can read the speed as a persistence-of-vision afterimage in your eye.

TODO: This needs to be seriously fleshed out.

What's included?
----------------

I currently have code, some photos of a stripboard-based Arduino shield, and some photos of the working project.

What will be included?
----------------------

I plan on using this project as an opportunity to refresh a range of skills, so eventually I will include:

    * An Arduino shield suitable for home manufacturing

    * A board design for an ATTINY85 based version (power supply to be decided)

    * A generic case design (3D printable)

    * Updated code to allow for input of desired speed range etc.

    * Possible other application-specific boards.
